Wow, it has been a while hasn't it? I think the last time I blog was at 2019 about how I am going to start blogging more, which aged perfectly at this point.

Well, instead of actually blogging, from now on, I am planning on starting to share small thoughts, lessons I learn, things I discover and like. This page will be more like a public bookmark engine rather than a personal blog from now on. Hence, I am not gonna move previos blog entries.

I was planning on learning how to use a tool like hugo or jeykell for sometime now for [Poltio Landing Page](https://www.poltio.com) Since we are not updating that page that often, using something like React is way overkill. But before I do that for Poltio, I felt more comfortable of exploring Hugo for this page.

This will bring another benefit, the old server that used to host my blog which was powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org) was a virtual machine that was running an older version of Ubuntu. Since I forget to upgrade that machine for a while, it was impossible to do relaase upgrade on it anymore. Which is exactly I hate this update cycles (rolling release FTW) (i use arch btw). I wish cloud providers offer more distros that uses rolling release. Long story short, with something static like Hugo, I don't need to manage my own hosting and just trust any cdn host to host and maintain my site. I picked [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) since I am a huge GH fan <3

Well, don't get your hopes high, if my past blogs were any indication, this will be probably the first and last entry, but if the stars align, I will post about, learning and using lua for nvim, kubernetes and gke, using rust and gtk4 and go probably.
